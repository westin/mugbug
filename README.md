# mugbug
*an old hacky project that im putting up here for archival reasons*

### WHAT
you know how when you brew tea you never know when it's a good temperature to drink? or how when you wait too long to drink it and it's too cold? drink too soon and you burn your mouth! this project was the solution:
 * mugbug was a simple program that ran on an a arduino with a LED ring, a waterproof thermometer, and a potentiometer. 
 * mugbug would rest on the edge of your mug, displaying the time remaining until the optimal temperature to drink, adjustable by the user with the dial (aka potentiometer) in the center. 
 * when mugbug knows it's OK to drink, the lights flash and make a rainbow pattern.

### WHY
it was for a class at carnegie mellon: gadgets, sensors, and activity recognition (05-833). i got an A so that's sweet. anyway-- i never worked on it again so i'm just putting the code up here for the historians.
 
### CLOSING THOUGHTS
this code is not pretty. i am sorry.
